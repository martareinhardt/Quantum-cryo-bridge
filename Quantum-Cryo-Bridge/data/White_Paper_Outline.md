The Quantum-Cryo-Bridge: A Modular System for High-Fidelity Qubit Protection and Scalable Data Transmission

## 1. Introduction
* **1.1. Background:** Overview of the need for stable, scalable quantum computing hardware.
* **1.2. Problem Statement:** Critical challenges in current cryostats: thermal load, volume/complexity, and I/O cross-talk (referencing limitations of existing dilution refrigerators).
* **1.3. Innovation (Q-BRIDGE):** Introduce the core solution: The multi-layered, modular, Dual-Channel Bridge architecture.
* **1.4. Contribution:** State the paper's key contributionâ€”a verified architecture capable of achieving FR-T.01 ($\le 20 \, \text{mK}$) and FR-Q.01 ($\ge 100 \, \mu s$) stability goals.

## 2. Q-BRIDGE System Architecture
* **2.1. Modular "Gym Weight" Design:** Detailed description of the physical form factor and how it supports vertical scalability (referencing FR-M.01 and Figure 1).
* **2.2. Cryogenic Stages and Isolation:** Overview of the multi-stage system (77K, 4K, mK) and material selection (referencing `input_material_properties.csv`).
* **2.3. Active Heat Evacuation System:** The role of the integrated micro/nanotubes in accelerating cool-down and managing residual gas conduction.

## 3. Computational Validation and Simulation
This section presents the results from the `simulations/` directory.

* **3.1. Thermal Performance (Ref: `1_thermal_model/`):**
    * Steady-State Heat Load analysis for the 4K and mK stages.
    * Validation of Cool-Down Time (FR-T.02) using the Nanotube Evacuation System.
