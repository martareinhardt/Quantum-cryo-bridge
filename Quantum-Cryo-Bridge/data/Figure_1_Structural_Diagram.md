# Figure 1: Cross-Sectional View and Modular Architecture

## 1. Description of Figure 1 (Cross-Sectional View)

Figure 1 provides a simplified, non-to-scale, cross-sectional view of the Quantum-Cryo-Bridge (Q-BRIDGE) system, illustrating the concentric arrangement of the cryogenic stages and the location of the core innovations.

### Key Components Illustrated:
1.  **Outer Vacuum Jacket (OVJ):** The outermost layer, typically Stainless Steel 304, maintaining the primary vacuum isolation.
2.  **77K Thermal Shield (Stage 1):** Cylindrical shield (Aluminum 6061-T6) thermally anchored to the 77K stage of the cryocooler.
3.  **Nanotube Evacuation Layer (Innovation):** A conceptual layer integrated between the OVJ and the 77K shield, representing the micro/nanotube array for improved heat and residual gas evacuation during cool-down.
4.  **4K Thermal Shield (Stage 2):** Inner cylindrical shield (Copper OFHC) thermally anchored to the 4K stage.
5.  **Qubit Module/Canister (Stage 3, mK):** The central core where qubits are housed. This includes the internal EM shielding layers and the connection points for the I/O data bridge.
6.  **Structural Support Rods:** Low-conductance materials (G-10/Vespel) connecting the stages to the warmer structure.
7.  **Dual-Channel Bridge Architecture:** Illustrating the two physically separated tubular channels (Send/Receive) running along the cryostat's length, maintaining distance from the main thermal stages and each other.

## 2. Modular ("Gym Weight") Architecture

The Q-BRIDGE's defining physical feature is its modularity, inspired by the shape of a dumbbell or a standard gym weight plate.

| Feature | Specification / Requirement | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Form Factor** | Cylindrical with standardized diameter (e.g., 500 mm) | Facilitates vertical stacking and integration into standard quantum data center racks. |
| **Interfaces** | Top and bottom faces include standardized mechanical and electrical connectors. | Allows multiple Q-BRIDGE units to be quickly linked (stacked) or replaced (hot-swapped). |
| **Center Module** | The main body contains the cryostat; the flat ends serve as the interface plates. | Separation of cryogenics from the connection interfaces for easy maintenance. |
| **Scaling** | The architecture is designed to support the stacking of N units to host a larger number of qubits (N x Qubit_Capacity). | Enables linear scalability of the quantum computer system. |
