# Q-BRIDGE Cryogenic System: Design Specifications

## 1. Introduction and Scope

This document details the engineering specifications for the **Quantum-Cryo-Bridge** (Q-BRIDGE) system, an advanced, modular cryogenic platform designed for the secure storage and transmission of nanoscale qubits. It serves as the primary reference for all simulation and hardware development efforts.

The design addresses critical limitations in existing systems, specifically focusing on **modularity**, **high thermal efficiency**, and **zero-cross-talk data transmission**.

## 3. Physical and Interface Specifications

### 3.1. Cryogenic Stages
The system utilizes a minimum of three stages with defined heat sinks:
1.  **Stage 1:** Outer Shield (Target: 77K)
2.  **Stage 2:** Inner Shield (Target: 4.2K)
3.  **Stage 3:** Qubit Module (Target: $< 20 \, \text{mK}$)

### 3.2. Nanotube Heat Evacuation
* **Purpose:** To actively pump heat and residual gas during the cool-down phase, reducing parasitic gas conduction.
* **Material Target:** High-conductivity carbon or boron nitride nanotubes.
* **Design Constraint:** Must not introduce significant vibration or EM noise once the mK stage is stable.

### 3.3. Dual Data Transmission Bridge
* **Configuration:** Two independent, vacuum-sealed tubular channels (Send and Receive).
* **Material Requirement:** Signal lines and inner shielding must use superconducting material below $T_c$ where feasible to minimize thermal load and resistive noise.

## 4. Modular ("Gym Weight") Architecture Requirements

The system's modularity is a critical non-functional requirement designed to facilitate scalability and serviceability in high-density quantum data center environments.

### 4.1. Physical Form Factor (FR-M.01 Detail)
* **Shape:** The cryostat's outer vacuum jacket (OVJ) must conform to a cylindrical shape, allowing for close-packing and vertical stacking.
* **Dimensional Constraint:** The outer diameter shall be standardized (e.g., 500 mm $\pm$ 5 mm) to fit within defined rack specifications.
* **Mass Constraint:** The wet mass (including cryocooler) shall not exceed 150 kg for ease of handling during installation and replacement.

### 4.2. Inter-Module Interfacing
* **Docking Mechanism:** Both the top and bottom faces of the OVJ must incorporate a standardized, quick-release mechanical docking interface.
* **Data Bridge Connectors:** The Dual-Channel Bridge architecture must terminate at robust, vacuum-compatible quantum data connectors on the interface plates.
    * **FR-D.02:** The connector interface must maintain the $\ge 100 \, \text{dB}$ cross-talk suppression between modules in a stacked configuration.
* **Thermal Anchoring:** The top plate shall include standardized thermal connections for linking to the system's external heat rejection stage, ensuring heat can be passed efficiently through a stack of modules.

### 4.3. Serviceability Goals
* The system must allow for the replacement of a single Q-BRIDGE module (unit) within a stacked array without compromising the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) integrity or the temperature of adjacent, operational units for a period of up to 4 hours.
